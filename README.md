## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Add your OpenAI API Key:**

   - In a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add  `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` at YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY
     
     REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY     
     ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: .env files should typically not be pushed to version control because they may contain sensitive information.
     However, for testing purposes, I pushed .env file (with no secrets included)**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser and visit:**

   ```
   http://localhost:5173
